## Description 

Proof of concept of audio raytracing where we input the geometry of a simple room and an audio file, then it generates an output file that shows how the audio file would sound inside the room.

*Status:* **In Progress**

Use cmake to build the project with cmake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

If building for MacOS:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Xcode ..
```
